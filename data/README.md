The folders here are some datasets as examples for SEM-CGCNN to work on, which can act as `root_dir` 
- sample-single and sample-multi are two toy datasets for a quick test.
- surface_property1 is the dataset of facets of binary Mg intermetallics
(can be generated with [instruction](../original_dataset))
- surface_property2 is the dataset of facets of pure Mg metals
(downloaded from [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org/))
- surface_property3 is the dataset of facets of various intermetallics
